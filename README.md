# Weekend Challenge #6: React-Redux with Sagas

## Description

*Duration: 3 Days*

We were asked to build a movie application. 

Movies were stored in a database with its title and poster displayed on initial page load. Users are able to click on an individual movie to see a detailed view for each including a description and genres associated with that movie. Users are also able to edit the movie's title and description.

Since there is no navigation available, routers were utilized to move the user forwards or backwards through button clicks to either return to the main list, edit the movie, cancel out of edit mode or save their changes. Each time a movie is modified, the individual movie details are immediately updated as is the main list.
